# CRUD-RESTful-API


# CRUD RESTful API with Java, MySQL, Spring Boot, JPA, and Maven

## Introduction

A brief introduction to your project, explaining what it does and its purpose. You can mention that it's a CRUD RESTful API built using Java, MySQL, Spring Boot, JPA, and Maven.

## Features

List the key features and functionalities of your CRUD API, such as:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a specific entity.
- RESTful endpoints for accessing the API.
- Data storage in a MySQL database using JPA.
- ...

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building web applications and RESTful APIs.
- MySQL: The chosen database management system for data storage.
- JPA (Java Persistence API): Used for object-relational mapping to interact with the database.
- Maven: Dependency management and build tool.

## Prerequisites

Outline the prerequisites or requirements needed to run your API, such as:

- JDK 8 or later
- MySQL database and connection details
- ...

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
- Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file.
- Build the project: `mvn clean install`
- Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
- The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/api/`

## API Endpoints

List and explain the available API endpoints and the supported operations (CRUD) for each endpoint.

- `GET /api/entity`: Get all entities.
- `POST /api/entity`: Create a new entity.
- `GET /api/entity/{id}`: Get a specific entity by ID.
- `PUT /api/entity/{id}`: Update an existing entity.
- `DELETE /api/entity/{id}`: Delete an entity by ID.
- ...

## Examples

Provide some examples of how to use the API endpoints, including sample requests and responses.

```http
GET localhost:8080/users

POST localhost:8080/save

[
 {
    "firstName": "Api_test001",
    "lastName": "Demo001",
    "age": 21,
    "occupation": "Developer"
},
{
    "firstName": "Api_test002",
    "lastName": "Demo002",
    "age": 22,
    "occupation": "Software Developer"
},
{
    "firstName": "Api_test003",
    "lastName": "Demo003",
    "age": 23,
    "occupation": "Hacker"
}
]

PUT localhost:8080/update/1
[
{
    "firstName": "Api_test_updated_user",
    "lastName": "Demo002_updated_user",
    "age": 22,
    "occupation": "Developer_updated_user"
}
